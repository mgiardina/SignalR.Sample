# SignalR.Sample

The code in the repository is a sample project that demonstrates how to use SignalR in an ASP.NET Core application. SignalR is a library for ASP.NET developers that simplifies the process of adding real-time web functionality to applications. It allows server-side code to push content to connected clients instantly as it becomes available, rather than waiting for the client to request new data.

The sample project contains a simple chat application that demonstrates how to use SignalR to send messages between clients in real-time. The project also includes a simple dashboard that displays real-time updates of stock prices using SignalR.
